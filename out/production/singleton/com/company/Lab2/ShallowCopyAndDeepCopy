Shallow copy and deep copy



Shallow copies duplicate as little as possible. A shallow copy of a collection is a copy of the collection structure,
not the elements. With a shallow copy, two collections now share the individual elements.


Deep copies duplicate everything. A deep copy of a collection is two collections with all of the elements
 in the original collection duplicated.
