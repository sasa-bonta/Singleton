Abstract Factory
https://stackabuse.com/creational-design-patterns-in-java/#abstractfactory

The Abstract Factory design pattern builds upon the Factory Pattern and acts as the highest factory in the hierarchy.
 It represents the practice of creating a factory of factories.


This pattern is responsible for creating all other factories as its sub-classes, exactly like how factories
are responsible for creating all of their own sub-classes.
